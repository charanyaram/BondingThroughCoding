    <h1>My Favourite Things</h1>
    <p>
      Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, <br />
      Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens, <br />
      Brown paper packages tied up with strings— <br />
      These are a few of my favorite things. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels, <br />
      Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles, <br />
      Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings— <br />
      These are a few of my favorite things <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes, <br />
      Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes, <br />
      Silver-white winters that melt into springs— <br />
      These are a few of my favorite things. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dog bites, <br />
      When the bee stings, <br />
      When I’m feeling sad, <br />
      I simply remember my favorite things <br />
      And then I don’t feel so bad! <br />
